<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function that takes in a string as its only argument, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Time: o(n*2) - this one's tough, it loops through the main list twice & within the second time, it loops several times - not great!!
