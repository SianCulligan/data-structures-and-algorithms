## Depth first preorder traversal on a graph

### Challenge
- Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

### Approach & Efficiency
Time = o(n)					
Space =	o(1)		

### Solution
