## Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Kth from end - o(1), by utilizing some simple math & a helper function rather than a loop, the method grabs the value right away regardless of length


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- n/a
