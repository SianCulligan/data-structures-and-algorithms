# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I chose a for loop to solve the problem, with a series of if statements to evaluate. Best case, it's bigO is o(1), but for all other cases, since it's dependant on the size of the array passed in, I believe it falls into o(n)
