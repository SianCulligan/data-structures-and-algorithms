# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I chose a while loop to solve the problem, since the BigO is dependant on the size of the array passed in, I believe it falls into o(n)
